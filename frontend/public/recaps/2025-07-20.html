<h2>🥇 Performance of the Week</h2>

<p><strong>Nash Kanji</strong> roasted Buffalo Creek with a +5 over quota, not exactly earth-shattering on a course this soft, but still incredible for a guy who can barely see over the steering wheel. Apparently all it takes is a sunrise six-pack and zero warm-up swings. He was sipping beer before most of us were lacing our shoes, and still managed to put up numbers tall enough to make up for the fact that he isn't.</p>

<hr>
<h2>🫠 Worst Performance of the Week</h2>
<p><strong>Mike Hanlon</strong> detonated a catastrophic −13, dropping lower than a frat pledge's standards at 2 a.m. The real crowd-pleaser, though, was <strong>Abel Tavera</strong>. Fresh off last week's heroics, he uncorked a −8 the moment the liquor started flowing, then sprayed cash around the payout table like a malfunctioning ATM at a strip club buffet.</p>

<h2>📈 Other Notables</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Jason</strong> aka the better looking Billy Bob Thornton tried turning his Vokey wedge into modern art by curling it around the golf cart frame. Anger issues? Nah, just passion man.</li>
  <li>The back tee degenerates (<strong>Abel, Jeff M., Bruce, and DJ</strong>) polished off TWENTY 99-proof shots before making the turn. Their livers are now listed on eBay in "used but spicy" condition.</li>
  <li>At the tenth tee <strong>Romeo</strong> shut down two kids who tried to cut the line. They smirked and asked if we were "professionals or something." His Marine stare started melting their confidence, but they still lingered, right up until <strong>Jamey</strong> coasted in with a look that said "I bounce trouble for fun." Suddenly those kids remembered a crucial homework emergency and bolted.</li>
  <li>Website revelation of the week: you can sort by money won. Minds were blown. Turns out cash is the real stat that matters. <strong>Jeff Morris</strong> guards first at $826 while <strong>Jason</strong> stalks at $760 and <strong>Adam Dickson</strong> lurks at $759 like a dollar-store hit man.</li>
  <li><strong>Leaderboard Movers:</strong> <strong>Jason</strong> vaulted three spots into the Top 10, <strong>Q</strong> climbed two, and <strong>Nash</strong> tiptoed past <strong>Jamey</strong>. Apparently half an inch is all it takes when the race is between two garden gnomes.</li>
  <li><strong>Jeff, Adam, Dahl, Raul, and Woody</strong> ditched us for Scotland, playing real links golf while we peasants slow roasted under Florida's broiler. May their pints be warm and their haggis, neeps, and tatties be flat, undercooked and reek of sheep's sweaty undercarriage. Just kidding, we are jealous and miss you!</li>
</ul>

<h2>🌴 Course Conditions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The fairways looked like someone tried to cut the grass with a flamethrower and then gave up halfway through.</li>
  <li>The cups were rejecting putts like they had trust issues and a personal vendetta against your scorecard.</li>
  <li>The heat was the kind that makes you question every life choice that led to playing golf in Florida in July.</li>
  <li>The air didn't move once. It felt like swinging a club inside a sauna built by your enemies.</li>
  <li>The gnats were aggressive. They swarmed your face, crawled into your ears, and treated your beer like it was their emotional support drink.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>📏 Rule(s) of the Week</h2>
<ul>
    <li>GCHL Rule 4.a - Don't be a dick.</li>
    <li>I keep getting asked about the rules around the FedUp Cup, they have been detailed on the website, DYOR. <a href=https://gulfcoasthackers.com/rules#fedup-cup target="_blank"> FedUp Cup Rules</a></li>
