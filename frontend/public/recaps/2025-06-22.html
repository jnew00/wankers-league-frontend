<h1>🏌️‍♂️ Gulf Coast Hackers Recap – Seminole Lake CC</h1>

<p><strong>👥 Players:</strong> 20</p>
<p><strong>🎯 CTPs:</strong> Dre Johnson (2), Terry Aunchman</p>
<p><strong>💣 Skins:</strong> Adam Dickson, Romeo McKenzie, David McCord</p>
<p><strong>🏅 Top Finishers:</strong> Johnny Vilela (1), Adam Shorts (2), Adam Dickson (T3), Q (T3), Jason Newberg (T3)</p>
<hr>
<h2>🥇 Performance of the Week</h2>
<p><strong>Johnny Vilela</strong> dropped a +10 on the field. He dismantled Seminole Lake like it was a warm-up round at Topgolf… and then ghosted the bar tab like it was a three-footer. Classic Johnny. And let's be honest—only a true Gator fan would choose to go nuclear at a course called Seminole. Disrespectful. Legendary. Petty perfection. Go Gators!</p>
<hr>

<h2>🫠 Worst Performance of the Week</h2>
<p><strong>Jeff Shorts</strong> found a new low—and I don't mean his launch angle. A –8 differential had his cart partner double-checking the math. Experts are still reviewing the footage, but rumor is his GPS got stuck in reverse. I blame <strong>Brian Quinn's</strong> drunk ass.</p>
<hr>

<h2>📈 Other Notables</h2>
<ul>
<li>The 17th hole featured a future cart-girl selling lemonade, but the real story was the Tito's-fueled MILF who made an appearance and might've broken some marriages. 10/10 entertainment.</li>
<li><strong>Brian Quinn</strong> went full blackout and hilariously tried calling out <strong>Terry</strong> for not qualifying his CTP. Plot twist: Terry did qualify—he meant <strong>Jeff Shorts</strong>. As already discussed in detail. Brain lag: 10 minutes.</li>
<li>The field was packed with drunken bastards, but somehow still "competitive." Just the way we like it.</li>
<li><strong>David McCord</strong> chipped in on the hardest hole to snag one of only three skins. Word is he slipped <strong>Q</strong> a $20 to "help" the ball in while no one was looking. Lucky (or shady?) bastard(s).</li>
<li><strong>Jason Newberg</strong> played Army golf—left, right, left—then dropped a birdie and ripped a skin right out of <strong>Adam Dickson's</strong> hands. Brutal. Efficient.</li>
<li>The Top 10 in the leaderboard froze like a bad Wi-Fi signal. None of them placed, some ground was gained… but the velvet rope holds strong.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>🌴 Course Conditions</h2>
<p>
Layout: Fun track with a psychotic stretch of three straight par 5s that makes or breaks you (and I think it broke most of us).<br>
Fairways: Wet and cart path only, but they were in great shape.<br>
Greens: Looked fantastic even if they played like concrete… harder than <strong>Nash</strong> at the lemonade stand.<br>
Food: No hot food—just cold sandwiches that legally required quotation marks. At least they weren't $18.<br>
Karen Bartender: Enforced the "quiet policy" exclusively at one table—the only one with a little melanin. Subtle stuff, really.<br>
Cart Girl: Cute and ripped shots with the group. A+ 🍻<br>
Final Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5 — Should throw it in the rotation.

<h2>📏 Rule(s) of the Week</h2>
<p>NO GIMMIES—Even if it's inside a 3-inch radius (aka one <strong>Adam Shorts</strong>), that's still a live ball. Don't make it weird, just putt.</p>
<p>Lift, Clean, and Place was in effect in the general area (not penalty or dry bunkers) since it was cart path only. I'll get with the Rules Committee to see if we can make this a standing rule going forward.</p>
