<h2>🥇 Performance of the Week</h2>
<p><strong>Jeff Morris</strong> erupted like a cheap bottle of gas station champagne, blasting out a fat +9 and leaving the rest of you hacks wondering if you'd accidentally wandered into a junior clinic. He racked up points so fast his scorecard looked like a damn bingo sheet. That 34-point blitz wasn't just hot—it was the best league score of the entire year, a silky 74 that had everyone choking on their White Claws in stunned silence. Pretty sure he wasn't exactly following rule 4.d, either. And let's be honest, when he rolls onto Bardmoor's 7,000+ yard Black tees next week with that 30 quota, he'll probably just take all our money again.</p>

<hr>

<h2>🫠 Worst Performance of the Week</h2>
<p><strong>Johnny Vilela</strong> proved that golf giveth and golf taketh away. Two weeks ago, he was riding high with a +10, but Sherman Hills, easily the most forgiving track we play, wasn't feeling generous this time. A -7 isn't the end of the world, but when everyone else is padding their stats, it's just enough to remind him that even the winners have to eat a turd sandwich now and then.</p>
<hr>

<h2>📈 Other Notables</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Q</strong> tried to claw back his "Par 3 Killer" crown with a couple CTPs, but the stats don't lie—<strong>Bryan Guy</strong> is the real apex predator out there, sitting on a league-leading 10 CTPs. Better get your ass in gear, Q.</li>
  <li>Somebody call Adult Protective Services for <strong>Dahl Phillips</strong>. He either lost a foot to diabetes, got spooked by the thought of a <strong>Jason</strong> wedge to the temple, or he's just one transfusion away from giving up on life altogether and waddling through TSA in nothing but a stained pair of skivvies.</li>
  <li><strong>Adam Shorts</strong> suggested handing out tampons to the whiners. Pretty rich coming from a guy who cries more than an abandoned puppy when he lips out a two-footer.</li>
  <li><strong>Bruce Almighty</strong> smacked the flagstick dead-on and got the tap-in, but let's not pretend it wasn't some cosmic bribe from the liquor gods. Maybe if he'd uncorked that hidden bottle of Crown earlier, <strong>Nash</strong> and <strong>Abel</strong> wouldn't have spent 16 holes playing like they were trying to finish last on purpose.</li>
  <li><strong>Woody Luke</strong> made a rare appearance but turned into a trembling little kitten at the thought of playing the back tees. Where's that tampon now, <strong>Adam</strong>?</li>
  <li><strong>Nick Peyton</strong> jumped up a spot on the leaderboard, because apparently just showing up sober is all it takes to look competent these days. Although, let's be honest—was he actually sober? Somebody better fact-check that.</li>
  <li><strong>David McCord</strong> lost two precious spots on the leaderboard, reminding everyone that even a half-decent short game can't save you when your driver is basically a random number generator.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🌴 Course Conditions</h2>
<p>The greens were covered in more distracting lines than a Miami coke party, and the place was soft as always. You could hear <strong>Jason</strong> muttering about "the lines, the lines" every time he three-putted like a toddler learning to walk.</p>
<hr>

<h2>📏 Rule(s) of the Week</h2>
<p>NO GIMMIES. I saw a few yank-backs. Sure, I'm sure those were all legit doubles—because on Sherman Hills, where everyone was posting hero scores, that totally checks out. Real believable. /s</p>
