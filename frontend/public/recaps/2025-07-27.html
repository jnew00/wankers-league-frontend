<h2>🥇 Performance of the Week</h2>
<p>
<strong>Bryan</strong> and <strong>Romeo</strong> brought the noise this week with matching +5 performances. <strong>Bryan</strong> played like the greens owed him money—locked in and collecting, even bagging a skin. Meanwhile <strong>Romeo</strong> just kept casually keeping pace, smiling like it was a casual stroll through Sunday brunch. It wasn’t flashy, but it was ruthless. Like a quiet hitman with a Scotty Cameron.
</p>

<h2>🫠 Worst Performance of the Week</h2>
<p><strong>Gary</strong> fell so hard off the scoring cliff he passed a few mountain goats on the way down. A -10 is one thing, but the real feat was keeping a smile on while watching everyone else cash skins like it was a stimulus check. Rumor is he finished the round with more swing thoughts than strokes.</p>
<hr>
<h2>📈 Other Notables</h2>
<ul>
  
<li><strong>DJ</strong> was paired with the geri crew, featuring <strong>Dovid</strong> and <strong>Lizard</strong>. Only one of them finished the round with both shoes on, and it wasn’t either of the elder statesmen. <strong>Lizard</strong> kicked his off to play a ball out of a swamp, and <strong>Dovid</strong> decided the back nine was a great time to cosplay a pirate—one shoe on, one foot out, full audition for Long John Silver. <strong>Dovid</strong>  skipped half the course and still tied <strong>Lizard</strong> at nine, which either means <strong>Dovid</strong> ’s a golfing genius or <strong>Lizard</strong> owes us all an apology.
<li><strong>DJ</strong>’s 27 from the back tees looked good on paper but felt empty inside. Without birdies, nobody drank a drop. Golf is cruel, especially sober golf.</li>
<li>Heard <strong>Q</strong> nearly became a referee between <strong>Nick</strong> and <strong>Abel</strong>. "These ahh the rues!" and "Who made you the enforcer?" rang out from the tee box like a Florida Judge Judy episode. Let me guess: <strong>Abel</strong> was massaging the lie in the rough again?</li>
<li><strong>Jamey</strong> exploded out the gate like a chihuahua spooked by fireworks, but sputtered out faster than a generator with water in the gas tank. Four birdie looks, one conversion, and a -5 finish that looked more like a protest than a round.</li>
<li><strong>Conner</strong> returned to the course after welcoming his daughter Charlee. He’s been keeping a newborn alive, but we’re worried the same can’t be said for his golf game. One’s thriving, the other’s decomposing.</li>
<li><strong>Jason</strong> is off in the mountains shooting lights out—reportedly dropped a 73 with five birdies from the tips on a Robert Trent Jones course. Don’t worry though, he’ll be back to shanking chips and blading wedges with the rest of you chumps soon.</li>


</ul>

<h2>🌴 Course Conditions</h2>
<p>
It was HOT. Like, "Abel saw the devil on 16" hot. Greens rolled fair and true, but the sun was unforgiving and the shade nonexistent. It was less of a round of golf and more of a desert survival course.

<h2>🏆 Top 10 Leaderboard</h2>

<p>Top 6? Didn’t budge an inch. It was like watching statues stand in for golfers—<strong>Lizard</strong>, <strong>Nash</strong>, <strong>Jamey</strong>, <strong>Nick</strong>, <strong>David</strong>, and <strong>Jeff</strong> all held firm. Either they’re that consistent, or they all agreed to keep each other company at the top. Bold strategy, let’s see if it pays off next week.</p>
