<h2>🥇 Performance of the Week</h2>
<p>It pains me to even type this, but <strong>Abel Tavera</strong> decided to show up and torch the field with a ridiculous +7 and rack up 30 points. No one wants to see this man on fire, mostly because he's so damn loud about it. He also scooped over $200 and then vanished faster than a fart in the wind so he didn't have to buy a single beer. Not that it matters—he probably won't even read this recap anyway. Good thing he's too scared to play <strong>Jason</strong> anymore, saved me some cash.</p>
<hr>

<h2>🫠 Worst Performance of the Week</h2>
<p><strong>Jeff Morris</strong> came crashing down to earth after a record low of 74 last week. Word from his group was that he took 'chubby' to an entirely new tier after that mid-round encounter with the pink spandex badonkadonk. Apparently when all the blood rushes south, your swing goes straight to hell. A –11 meltdown after that little rendezvous. Some guys can't handle their booze, others can't handle an ass you could park a Buick on.</p>

<h2>📈 Other Notables</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Jamey</strong>'s Birthday Edition – <strong>Bryan Guy</strong>'s was the day before, but this round was all about Jamey trying to outdrink common sense.
    <ul>
      <li>He knocked back 7-8 shots, a few beers, and a couple of double transfusions like it was a corner store special and he had coupons. He said he was heading to see <em>Superman</em>, but last I heard he was still in row G, half-passed out and mumbling about shanks, Henny, and pink cakes to a confused usher.</li>
      <li>Standing over a 20-foot birdie putt on 18, <strong>Jamey</strong> slurred, "I can't even see the ball." We told him to hit the one in the middle, and damned if he didn't drain it. Maybe he should play blind more often.</li>
      <li>Rumor has it that he came stumbling out from behind a tree on the wrong fairway, hat cockeyed, casually mumbled "hey guys," and zig-zagged back to his group like it was the most normal thing ever.</li>
      <li>Most of the round, he was hypnotized by the big booty in pink spray-on Lululemons. She was chipping his balls in more ways than one. I left for the green after hearing her say "I need a hotdog," and you can imagine how that conversation spiraled.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Bryan Guy</strong> is hoarding CTPs again, snagging another just as Q thought he was catching up. Keep grindin', <strong> Q.</strong> I'm just grateful I was there to see the legends in action.  </li>
  <li><strong>Jeff Shorts</strong> managed to lip out 8 putts all by less than an inch, and somehow played a round with zero pars but a birdie. On 18, he missed an eagle by two inches (or an <strong>Adam Shorts</strong> as we call it). Some would call that bad luck, I call it Sunday.</li>
  <li>Welcome (or welcome back?) to <strong>David Harris</strong> of PGC fame, who wasted no time in introducing himself by taking our money with a big shit-eating grin. Welcome to the party!</li>
  <li><strong>Jason Newberg</strong> debuted his new $1,000 putter he wouldn't shut up about. Unsurprisingly, his 3-putt average only climbed higher. Turns out it's not the wand—it's the wizard. Who knew?</li>
<li><strong>Abel</strong> vaulted up 5 spots and cracked the top 10 for the first time all season. See, all it takes is one good week to make the rest of us question our life choices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🌴 Course Conditions</h2>
<p>Bardmoor sucks. Water seems to lurk perfectly wherever your ball wants to go, and the greens were like a Tinder date—looked smooth from a distance but up close, it was all bumps and disappointment. Aside from a few anomalies, the place chewed up everyone's scorecard.</p>
<hr>

<h2>📏 Rule(s) of the Week</h2>
<p><strong>GCHL Rule 3e:</strong> If you are not able to finish a round due to injury or weather (and everyone must quit), your score doesn't count and you don't have to pay for the money games. Don't worry <strong>Dovid</strong>, I've got your $24 entry ready for next time. Get well soon.</p>
<p><strong>USGA Rule 5.5b:</strong> The player may practise putting or chipping on or near:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The putting green of the hole just completed and any practice green (see Rule 13.1e), and</li>
  <li>The teeing area of the next hole.</li>
</ul>
<p>But such practice strokes must not be made from a bunker and must not <strong style="background-color: yellow;">unreasonably delay play</strong> (see Rule 5.6a).</p>
